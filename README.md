<h4>Summary:</h4>
<p>My chosen framework was tailwinds, as it's been attributed with having a balance of defaults and ease of customization. I found with working with it, it has a lots of predefined elements to make it simplify your code. Although some of the issues I have with it is trying to familiarize myself with it's different components which will most likely take far longer than a few classes on it.</p>
<br>
<h5>Attributions:</h5>
<p>I snagged most of the code from some of the example templates of Tailwind, while the image I used for my title image I attribute to myself and the Sparrows lockpicking company for developing it.</p>
